# Notes

## Commands

### Run Tests

npm run test
npm run test -- --coverage (with coverage)

## Linting

npm run format
npm run lint:fix (not doing anything at the moment)
npm run lint (giving an error)

## UI

Tried not to use css library such as bootsrap or reactstrap. So used css flex boxes for designs

## Unit Testing

Need to find out an approach to mock the graphql api call and fully test ProductList for all scenarios

## Linting

Sine the project react version doesn't support the latest eslint versions, error was occured while trying to run the tests.
After the fix linting is yet to be fixed but the prettier format is working fine.
